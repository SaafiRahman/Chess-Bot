# Chess-Bot

## Overview
This Python-based chess bot implements the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to find the best move in a given chess position. The combination of Minimax and alpha-beta pruning enhances the efficiency of the bot by reducing the number of nodes explored during the search process.

## Features
- **Minimax Algorithm:** The bot utilizes the Minimax algorithm to explore possible moves in the chess game tree and determine the best move.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Alpha-beta pruning enhances the Minimax algorithm by eliminating branches that cannot affect the final decision. This reduces the number of nodes evaluated, making the algorithm more efficient.
- **Python Implementation:** The entire project is written in Python, using the library python-chess, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend.
